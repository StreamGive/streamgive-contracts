# CI run even when a change stays under the limit. Soroban resource fees
# scale partly with contract size, so a creeping regression here is easy to
# miss without an explicit check.

# When a change legitimately grows a contract past its budget, raise that
# contract's limit in the same PR rather than working around this script.
